As a backend developer in the team "Digital Distribution" of the [Magicline](https://www.magicline.com/en/) I was part of a 6-member international and cross-functional team which was responsible for making the [Magicline](https://www.magicline.com/en/) available to end customers both on a test basis and in the further process for a fee. The goal was to automate the process as much as possible and to simplify the familiarization with the [Magicline](https://www.magicline.com/en/) so that the end customers can start using the [Magicline](https://www.magicline.com/de/) on their own.
