# Biography

I am currently employed as [DevOp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and [Scrum Master](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm) at the [Research Data Center (FDZ)](https://fdz.dzhw.eu/en/index_html) of the [German Center for Higher Education and Science Research (DZHW)](https://www.dzhw.eu/en/index_html). Since 2015, I (as part of an interdisciplinary team) have been developing a [search and documentation portal](https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu/#!/en) for the data sets available at the FDZ. This portal is developed openly [on GitHub](https://github.com/dzhw/metadatamanagement).

Before my time at the DZHW, I first worked as a consulting software engineer at [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/?georedirect_none=true) after studying [mathematical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_economics) at the [Clausthal University of Technology](https://www.tu-clausthal.de/en/info/). After my time at Capgemini, I was employed for a short time as IT coordinator at [KKH](https://www.kkh.de/other-languages/willkommen-bei-der-kkh-englisch). I then moved to [Zühlke Engineering](https://www.zuehlke.com/de/en/), where I again worked as a consulting software engineer.

During the time at Zühlke I became seriously mentally ill at the end of 2011. During the recovery period my son Tammo was born in 2013 and I came into contact with the DZHW, where, as mentioned at the beginning, I have been working since 2015. My second son Michel was born in 2016.
