# Biography

I am currently looking for a new challenge as a Software Engineer. In the past I have worked in different [projects](#projects) as a backend developer or full stack developer and [DevOp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) or [Scrum Master](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm). At DZHW, for example, I worked in an interdisciplinary team to develop a [search and documentation portal](https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu) for the datasets available at the Research Data Center of the DZHW. This portal continues to be developed openly [at GitHub](https://github.com/dzhw/metadatamanagement).

Before my time at the DZHW, I first worked as a consulting software engineer at [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/?georedirect_none=true) after studying [economic mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_economics) at the [Clausthal University of Technology](https://www.tu-clausthal.de/en/info/). After my time at Capgemini, I was employed for a short time as IT coordinator at [KKH](https://www.kkh.de/other-languages/willkommen-bei-der-kkh-englisch). I then moved to [Zühlke Engineering](https://www.zuehlke.com/de/en/), where I again worked as a consulting software engineer.

During the time at Zühlke I became seriously mentally ill at the end of 2011. In the following recovery period my son Tammo was born in 2013. In 2016 my second son Michel was born and completed our family.
