As a member of the [DZHW](https://www.dzhw.eu) I was part of a 5 person team as [Scrum Master](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm), Full Stack Developer and DevOp that developed a [search portal](https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu) for social science research data. Currently, this portal is being further developed and operated. The entire development process takes place openly at [GitHub](https://github.com/dzhw/metadatamanagement).
