In this internship at [Virtusa](https://www.virtusa.com/about-virtusa/) in Sri Lanka I dealt with the topic [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and web services. I was part of an R&D team and developed a proof-of-concept for composing web services with BPEL. Here I mapped a small internal team process. I passed on the findings of this PoC in tech talks to the company's employees.
